Initialising a minimal, TFC-connected, codebase

1. copy this repo, without the .git files, to the `terraform` directory in your project
1. in TFC/TFE, create a workspace with your required name
   1.    1. it should be something like `<project>_<env>` e.g. cchne_dev
1. set the value of `TF_WORKSPACE` in the [env_dev.sh file](./env-dev.sh)
   1. it should be the same as the workspace name in the above step
1. set the value of TF_VAR_env in the [env_dev.sh file](./env-dev.sh)
    1. it should be the same as the <env> suffix in `TF_WORKSPACE`
1. run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` etc
1. iterate youe infra as required from there

If you dont need a TFC-connected experience, uncomment the local state storage directive in the terraform.tf file,
or customise as required (azure storage, AWS S3 etc)
